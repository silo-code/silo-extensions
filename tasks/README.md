# Tasks

A task list that lives in [Silo](https://github.com/silo-code/silo), right next to the code — **no tracker to sign into, and nothing written into your repo**.

You know what you meant to do next. It's in a scratch file, or a sticky note, or a `TODO` you'll never grep for again. Putting it in Jira feels absurd — it's a note to yourself, not a ticket. So it stays in your head, and then it doesn't.

Tasks gives you the thing in between: a real list, per workspace, one keystroke from the code it's about. Type it in the box at the bottom of the panel and get back to work.

## What you get

- **A list per workspace, plus one that's just yours** — open a repo, get its list. The personal list rides along in every workspace for the things that aren't about any one project.
- **Capture in one line** — the quick-add box is docked at the bottom of the panel, always there. Type, hit Enter, keep going. It always lands in the workspace you're looking at, so there's nothing to pick.
- **Detail when you want it, not before** — a row is one quiet line: status, title, priority. Hover for the rest. Click to open the full page — description, due date, labels, and a checklist of acceptance criteria — then hit Escape to get back to the list.
- **Slice it however you think** — group by list, status, or label; sort by creation order, recency, priority, or title; filter down to a lane or a label; search by title, label, or exact task id. The panel remembers your setup per workspace.
- **Four lanes, not a workflow engine** — To do, In progress, Blocked, Done. Enough to see what's stuck, not enough to need a manual.
- **Your agent can write to it** — every list is a plain JSONL file in a stable location. Point Claude Code or any other agent at it in one line of `AGENTS.md` and it can file its own follow-ups while it works. The panel picks up outside edits the moment they land.
- **Nothing leaves your machine** — no account, no sync, no network. The extension requests **zero permissions**.

## Where your tasks live

One newline-delimited JSON file per list, in the extension's own storage directory — outside every repo, so nothing ever shows up in `git status`:

```
~/.config/silo[-<identity>]/extension-storage/silo.tasks/
├── global/tasks.jsonl                      ← the personal list
└── workspaces/<workspaceId>/tasks.jsonl    ← one per workspace
```

Each line is one task:

```json
{"v":1,"id":"t_ab12_00001x9k","title":"Ship the RFC","lane":"todo","priority":"high","rank":"000000000004","labels":["docs"],"description":"...","dueDate":"2026-09-15","acceptanceCriteria":[{"text":"tests green","done":false}],"createdAt":1756600000000,"updatedAt":1756600000000,"closedAt":null}
```

`lane` is one of `todo | in_progress | blocked | done`. A line the extension can't parse — a hand-edit typo, or a record from a newer Silo — is **kept verbatim** and written back untouched, never dropped; a quiet notice names the file so you can fix it.

### Handing the list to an agent

Add one line to your repo's `AGENTS.md`:

```
Task list: read/append tasks as NDJSON at
~/.config/silo/extension-storage/silo.tasks/workspaces/<id>/tasks.jsonl
(one JSON object per line, keep the `v` and `rank` fields).
```

Every write the extension makes is compare-and-swap — it re-checks the file right before replacing it and re-applies rather than clobbering someone else's write. The window isn't quite zero: a write landing inside the final check→rename gap is still lost. Fine for a task list; if you're scripting heavy concurrent appends, expect the occasional lost line.

## Commands

| Command                     | Does                                     |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `silo.tasks.newInWorkspace` | New task in the current workspace's list |
| `silo.tasks.refresh`        | Reload every list from disk              |

Both run usefully with no arguments, so either can take a keyboard shortcut — assign them in **Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts** (search "Tasks"). Given a title, `newInWorkspace` creates the task outright and hands it back, which is what makes it worth calling from another extension or an agent; with no title it reveals the panel and drops the caret in quick-add.

## Requirements

Silo **0.65 or newer**.

## Permissions

None. Tasks are stored locally in the extension's own storage and nothing leaves your machine.

## Installing

### From a GitHub Release

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/silo-code/silo-extensions/releases?q=tasks).
2. Right-click the `.tgz` asset → **Copy link address**.
3. In Silo: **Settings → Extensions**, paste the URL and click **Install**.

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/silo-code/silo-extensions
cd silo-extensions/tasks
npm install
npm run build
```

Then in Silo: **Settings → Extensions → Install from folder**, point at this directory.

## Building

```sh
npm install
npm run build        # one-shot, esbuild → dist/index.js
npm run build:watch  # watch mode
npm run typecheck
npm test             # unit tests
```

Phase 1 of [RFC 0031](https://github.com/silo-code/silo/blob/main/docs/proposals/0031-tasks-extension/proposal.md); the proposal lives in the main `silo-code/silo` repo.

`src/model/` and `src/lib/` are pure and import the SDK for types only, so the unit tests never load the SDK runtime. `src/providers/` holds the JSONL store, `src/ui/` the React components, and `src/index.ts` is wiring: registrations, commands, and the panel.

### Two surfaces are built but disabled

RFC 0031's phase 2 added two **aggregating** surfaces over the same source set, and both are **switched off** for the first public release — they need more work before they go in front of users:

- the Navigator's cross-workspace **Tasks** view, with its own header controls, which hands a picked task to the Tasks app; and
- the **Tasks app** sheet — every open workspace's list in a dock-anchored, non-modal sheet with multiline rows, a composer with a list picker, and batch editing.

`NAVIGATOR_VIEW_ENABLED` and `TASKS_APP_ENABLED` in `src/index.ts` are both `false`, so the view and its three `"navigator"`-surface toolbar items are not registered, and neither are `silo.tasks.open` / `silo.tasks.newInApp` — the only two entry points to the sheet, which is why gating those commands is what turns the app off. The code behind both (`ui/CrossTasksView.tsx`, `ui/TasksAppSheet.tsx`, the `CROSS_SCOPE` / `SHEET_SCOPE` prefs, `lib/menus.ts`'s `viewMenu`, `commands.openApp`) stays in the build and under test; flipping the flags brings each back. Turn the app on before the view — the view's rows click into the sheet.

### Dependencies

This extension depends on RFC 0032's `ctx.storage.globalDir()` / `workspaceDir()` and the `ctx.files` own-dir sandbox lift; on `ctx.storage.workspaceDirs()` for the (disabled) cross-workspace surfaces, which resolves a storage directory for every open workspace in one call; and on `NavigatorViewProps.panelId`, which is what lets the Navigator view anchor the Tasks app sheet to its own column. Those land in `@silo-code/sdk` **0.46.0** and Silo **0.65.0** — the SDK devDependency and `silo.engine` pins.

`silo.engine` is informational (the host does not enforce it), so the sheet degrades rather than breaking on an older app: without `panelId` it anchors to the Tasks side panel, which is where it opened before this shipped.
