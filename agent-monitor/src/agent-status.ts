/**
 * The per-terminal agent-status state machine — the pure, unit-tested core of
 * the extension. `index.tsx` feeds it events (OSC detections, terminal
 * activations) and renders the derived row/badge; all the rules live here.
 *
 * The model it implements:
 *
 * - A terminal is an **agent** if it was created as one (kind `"claude"`/`"pi"`)
 *   or an agent-specific OSC detector fires in it (covers typing `claude` into
 *   a plain shell). Plain shell-integration traffic (OSC 133) on a kind-`"shell"`
 *   terminal demotes it again once the agent process is gone.
 * - While an agent is **working** it shows a busy row (with a start timestamp
 *   so the host renders elapsed time).
 * - When work stops (working → waiting) the terminal is **finished, unseen**
 *   (green "ok" row + attention badge) — sticky until the user views it.
 *   If the user was already viewing it, it skips straight to done.
 * - **Activation** (the user views the terminal) acknowledges a finished run:
 *   waiting → **done**, which keeps its row (status-less → grey dot) but drops
 *   the tab badge. Done is sticky against the agent's recurring idle signal;
 *   only a new working/error signal moves it.
 *
 * Non-agent terminals derive no row and no badge, whatever their activity.
