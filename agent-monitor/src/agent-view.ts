/**
 * The pure, unit-tested projection layer: turns a host-computed
 * {@link AgentInfo} (from `ctx.agents`) into the Workspaces-panel status row
 * and terminal-tab badge this extension renders. Since Silo 0.39 the host
 * owns *all* detection, persistence, stale-gap tracking, and reboot recovery —
 * so this module carries none of that; it only decides how the shared agent
 * state should *look*.
 *
 * The visual vocabulary it maps onto:
 *
 * - **working** → a working Activity row (with `workingSince` so the host
 *   renders elapsed time) and a spinner tab badge.
 * - **idle + needsAttention** → the "finished, unseen" state: a green `ready`
 *   row + check tab badge, sticky until the user views the terminal (at which
 *   point the host clears `needsAttention` via `ctx.agents.acknowledge`).
 * - **idle + acknowledged** → a neutral/grey row (no activity glyph) and no
 *   tab badge — the run finished and has been seen.
 * - **error** → a red `error` row + badge.
 * - **dead** → a `warn` row + badge: the terminal's backend was confirmed gone
 *   after an unclean shutdown (new in `ctx.agents`). The tab tooltip surfaces
 *   the agent's `resumeCommand` when the host resolved one.
 * - **none** (never ran, or a plain non-agent shell) → no row, no badge.
